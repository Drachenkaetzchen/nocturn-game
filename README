This is a simple game for two players based on the Novation Nocturn USB Controller [1]. This is a test implementation of the (not completely) reverse engineered USB protocol of the controller.

Game Instructions:
- Start the python script once your Novation Nocturn is connected
- Press any controller key to start the game
- Goal of the game is to push the buttons on your side faster than your opponent does
- Once you hit the right button, you get a score of +1
- If you reach a score of 11, the round is over. The player who has the highest overall score sees his side blinking
- If you have won 6 rounds, you win

This is my first python program, so it is awful. No really, it is awful.
